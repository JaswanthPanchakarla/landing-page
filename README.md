# 🇮🇳 Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Tribute Page

Welcome to my tribute project! This is a responsive landing page dedicated to the life and legacy of **Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose**. 

This project was built to practice modern CSS layouts while honoring the "People's Hero" who led the Azad Hind Fauj.
